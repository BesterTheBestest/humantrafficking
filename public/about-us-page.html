      <div class="col s6"><span class="flow-text">Hi, my name is Kalah Bester and I'm from Philadelphia, Pa and
        yes, it's pronounced as Kayla. I'm currently a freshmen at Strawberry Mansion High School
        and for me personally, Human Trafficking has always been important. 
        It bothers me dearly that it goes unnoticed so much.
        Our young chldren are being taken away from their parents and the news won't even try to report it. Roughly 465,676 children have been reported missing in the past year and are probably still out here. 
        It's time that we stand up to human trafficking and finally make a change.
        My partner and I hope that creating this website could help and give others more incite on what we could do to make this problem goes noticed. 
        I know that there are probably 1,000 other websites focusing on the same
        agenda, but hopefully people get to realize how serious this situation is on our website.

      <div class="col s6"><span class= "flow-text">hi, my name Iyana hannibal I attend strawberry mansion high school. I am 15 years old and I particapte in lacrosse 
        and track in field, at my high school. My goal for the future is to become an ultrasound technision. i always thought about traveling after i got out of college
        and doing the things im to afraid of acting on.
        Human trafficking caught my attention this year 
        when I decided to do a reseach project on this social issue.This is a big problem thats been going on for years and no one really pays
        any attention to it. Parents been losing their children to this crime for many of years and its time for people to really stand up and try to make a change
         and get this issue noticed. Kids from ages 3 and up have been forced into this system, and gotten their childhood taken away from them. Kids have been sexually
        abused, killed, and drugged just someone can make some money off of their body
        my partner and I on this website want you and whoever else reading this to, take a stand and seriously help these kids. </span>
