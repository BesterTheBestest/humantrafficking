          Victims of trafficking often experience harsh physical impacts due to excessive work or the use of force by traffickers. 
          In addition, victims may be exposed to serious health risks, such as HIV/AIDS, as well as serious mental health risks.
          Anxiety, insecurity, fear, and trauma are all products of trafficking.
